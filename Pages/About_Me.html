        <h4>Arkwright Scholarship – 2013</h4>
        <p>The Arkwright Scholarship is worth a total of £1000 to put towards education so that students can reach their full potential. Students in year 11 apply so that they are able to fund their two years of college education. The students involved are engineering based and many companies sponsor them in order to increase the number of engineers for the future. I was one of the 273 students chosen that year to receive the scholarship. My sponsor was Aero Engine Controls which specialises mainly within the aerospace industry and was able to visit their sites in Derby and Birmingham to gain specific knowledge for the future.</p>
