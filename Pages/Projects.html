        <p>Sophie was challenged to create and develop a full game using JavaScript, HTML5 (without canvas), and CSS3. The game Sophie produced was a replica version of Nokia’s Snake from 1997. The project was spread over a week and split into 2 sprints. The objective of sprint 1 was to have a functional game that was playable by a user. She overestimated how long this would take and so had to add extra features to the original game later on. The objective of sprint 2 was to add styling to the game and ensure the code was dry and well written. As mentioned, extra features such as lives and poison in sprint 2 as the game scope was too small and got completed quickly.</p>
        <p>The whole project was a success and all goals set out at the start were achieved. The game was presented in front of the academy once sprint 2 was over.</p>

        <h3>Project 2</h3>
        <h5>FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT – CIRCLE OF YOUNG INTRAPRENEURS</h5>
        <img class="pro-img" src="../COYI.png" alt="Stuff">
        <p>This was the first group project that the class were involved in. The week was split into 2 sprints, with Sophie being one of the scrum masters for the first. This involved organising her own scrum team to do the tasks allocated to that group. The group were given a variety of user stories, prioritised using MoSCoW, that were separated into the 4 scrum teams. The MUST user stories were put in sprint 1 and the SHOULD/COULD user stories were put into sprint 2.</p>
        <p>During the first sprint, the group were tasked to create a fully functional website that someone could navigate through. Sophie’s objective was to create the site map given to the group in the starting documentation. This involved using front-end and back-end development to make sure the web pages were laid out correctly and able to be linked where needed.</p>
        <p>During the second sprint the scrum masters were changed over within the teams. Sophie was then more involved with front-end development to remove all inconsistency throughout the web pages so the overall look was simple and professional.</p>
        <p>Tools used: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4.1, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Devise, Pundit, PostgreSQL and Git.</p>
